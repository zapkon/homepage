Nobody wants data. What everybody wants are answers.
I am exploring relationships in economics, shareconomy, news media, sports with methods like time series analysis, social-network-analysis, quantitative linguistics and machine learning in .R and always seeking for newer and better methods to answer emerging questions.

I like to combine and explore unintuitive cross-discipline datasets and methods and examine the results.
